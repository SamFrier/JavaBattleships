# JavaBattleships

An implementation of the game Battleships in Java using a command line interface.
Made during my first week of training.
I might eventually extend it to use a GUI or otherwise make it actually playable, but probably not.

(Also I've been using this repo to test Jira's GitHub integration, which explains the weird commit history)
